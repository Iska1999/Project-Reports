# Project-Reports
A repository with project reports I have done in the past.

NVD Report was a deliverable for my data mining internship, where I data wrangled the NVD Database by NIST and investigated factors that impact patch rollout.
Data Mining project was the final deliverable of SYS-6018 (data mining), where I investigated different machine learning models for a rescue mission in Haiti.
